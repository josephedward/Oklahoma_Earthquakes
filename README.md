**Dataset: Oklahoma Earthquakes and Saltwater Injection Wells**
https://www.kaggle.com/ksuchris2000/oklahoma-earthquakes-and-saltwater-injection-wells#InjectionWells.csv

**Major Questions:**
- Do frequency of earthquakes increase with proximity to injection wells?
- Can the data be used as a general predictor of proximity or timing of future earthquakes?


*Sub-Bullets*
- Do the average daily PSI rates have more earthquakes around them?
- Do the total BBLs injected have more earthquakes around them?
- Create a map of where the earthquakes are and where the wells are located
- Plot of number of wells drilled over the years of given dataset compared to the number of earthquakes that happened over the timeframe
